# Movie Booking System
A dark-themed cinematic booking experience, forged with the power of Laravel, where users step into a shadowy portal to explore films, reserve seats, and claim their passage into the world of cinema. This system is crafted not just as a tool but as a complete experience, embodying nearly every feature a modern movie booking system demands.
