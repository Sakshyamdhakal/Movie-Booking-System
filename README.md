A **dark-themed cinematic booking experience**, built with the might of **Laravel**, where users step into a shadowed portal to explore films, summon seats, and secure their passage into the halls of cinema.  

This project embodies **nearly every feature a modern movie booking system requires**, crafted with precision, scalability, and a gothic aesthetic.
